Otherwise, please explain how a user should execute your code and run your tests if someone else were to clone down this repo. Please include Big Oh time complexity for traversal of your binary tree. 
- Big Oh Time complexity for all traversals is O(n) time complexity, with n being the number of nodes. The big O space complexity is O(1). 
- For a pre-order traversal we should expect the binary tree's nodes to be read as `root left right`
- For a post-order traversal we should expect the binary tree's nodes to be read as `left right root`
- For an in-order traversal we should expect the binary tree's nodes to be read as `left root right`
